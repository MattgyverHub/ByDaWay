<p>Questionably inspirational quotes, whether you care to know them or not. These are quotable sayings from that &quot;one guy at work&quot; that leave us laughing, confused, angry, or just plain dumb-founded. More of a joke than anything else, this site could be repurposed for anything that delivers random quotes (json async data) with more details loaded into a modal.</p>
<h1 id="what-this-is">What This Is</h1>
<p>This is a simple randomized quote website to serve up the bonkers stuff my co-worker says. The website uses jQuery and a simple json file to load the quotes. JS handles randomizing the quotes, loading specific quotes via query string, applying color styling to elements, and more.</p>

<li>Number animation: Countup</li>
<li>CSS: Mostly custom, uses Bourbon Neat for the responsive structure, also Normalize for general misc.</li>
<li>Quotes: 100% crazy talk from the guy at work. Seriously can&#39;t make this stuff up.</li>
<li>Build process: I&#39;m using PrePros for the build process. Small site, so no need to Gulp this.</li>
</ul>

<li>Would love to redo the css a bit and use variables rather than all the unique style blocks. The background is a gradient and needs a cross-fade, so I was scratching my head for a while. Just decided to hard code vars and not throw more things into the js.</li>
<li>The Google event triggers might need to be redone a little. I updated the tracking code overall, but these may not work. </li>
</ul>
